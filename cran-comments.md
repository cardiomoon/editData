This is an update of the package 'editData'.

1) I have rewrite vignette to explain modularized functions. These module are intended for reuse across applications.

2) I have added several executable exmaples in the `inst` folder.

3) Several bugs fixed.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
