This is the resubmission of the package 'editData'.

1) I added single quotes to package names(e.g. 'RStudio') in title and description. 

2) I added executable exmaples in editData.Rd and numericInput3.Rd

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
