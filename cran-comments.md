This is an update of the package 'editData'.

1) I had released 'editData' package(version 0.1.1) several days ago, but some bugs were found.
   So I have to update my package. I am sorry about that. 

2) I have rewrite vignette to explain modularized functions. These module are intended for reuse across applications.

2) I have added several executable exmaples in the `inst` folder.

3) Several bugs fixed.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
